## :tada: Welcome to the XKE demo course!

This course serves as a demo for Github learning lab. 

### The flow of a learning lab?

In a Github learning lab you can use `issues` and `pull requests` to guide the learner through your course. Issues are a central part of github and of github learning lab courses. You can create an issue which describes a certain task or problem. When you present the learning with the next task or problem, close the current issue and create a new one.

## Step 1: Use an issue for communication

An issue is used as a "conversation" with the learner, you can have more than one step per issue by having the learning bot responding to the open issue after the user completes a certain action. This issue will demonstrate this behaviour in a simple way.
